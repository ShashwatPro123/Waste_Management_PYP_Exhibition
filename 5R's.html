            You’ve probably heard of the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. These terms were first popularized in the late-1970s, following the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The idea was simple: Give the public a motto for reducing waste to curb North Americans’ seemingly unstoppable proclivity for making trash and to aid governments’ abilities to manage it.
            We use the 5 R's. They stand for Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repurpose and Refuse. These are used in waste
            management. The Five Rs give us a new framework for dealing with waste in our lives, in part by helping us
            acknowledge the habits that lead to more waste and more trash. <br> Despite our familiarity with the three Rs, and the fact that “zero waste” trends seem to be advancing at lightning speed, waste is still a huge problem around the world, and one that continues to grow exponentially. <br> In 2013, <b>Bea Johnson</b> gave the world the Five Rs in her book <b>Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying Your Life by Reducing Your Waste. They are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose</b>. The Five Rs give us a new framework for dealing with waste in our lives, in part by helping us acknowledge the habits that lead to more waste and more trash.</p>
