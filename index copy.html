            Liquid Waste

            Liquid waste refers to all grease, oil, sludges, wash water, waste detergents and dirty water that have been thrown away. They are hazardous and poisonous to our environment and are found in industries as well as households. Wastewater, as it is often called, is any waste that exists in liquid form.

            Solid Waste

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Solid waste is any garbage, sludge, and refuse found in industrial and commercial locations. The five major types of solid rubbish are;

            Glass and Ceramics: Numerous companies readily recycle ceramics and glass. The catch here is that you have to dispose of them correctly.
            Plastic waste: Plastic waste is any container, jar, bottle, and bag that is found in companies and houses. Plastics are non-biodegradable, and most of them cannot be recycled. Do not mix plastic rubbish with regular waste. Instead, sort them out before throwing them away.
            Paper rubbish: This refers to all newspapers, packaging materials, cardboards, and other paper products. Paper is recyclable.
            Metals and Tins: You can easily find tins and metals in homes because food containers and household materials are made from them. Most metals are recyclable, so take them to a scrap yard or recycling depot after use. You should get a skip hire and use it to transport your solid waste.        </p>

        <h1 id="Header3">
            Organic Waste
        </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Organic waste refers to rotten meat, garden and food waste. This type of rubbish is commonly found in homes. With time, they decompose and turn into manure by the action of microorganisms on them. But be careful; you should not dispose of them anywhere you like.

            When decomposing, organic waste produces methane, so, it must not be thrown away with regular waste. Instead, get a green bin and dispose of this type of waste properly.        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="Header4">
            Recyclable Waste        </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            All discarded items like metals, furniture, organic waste that can be recycled fall under this category. Not all items are recyclable, so you have to be careful when putting things into the recycle bin. If you are not sure whether an item is recyclable or not, then check the itemâ€™s packaging.        </p>

        <p>
